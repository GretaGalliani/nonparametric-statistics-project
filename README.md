### Abstract
This work aims to assess the importance of radiomic features, alongside clinical features, in classifying and predicting the outcomes in the development 
of Cholangiocarcinoma. We addressed the same questions in our work for the Applied Statistics course, applying parametric logistic regression models. 
Due to restrictions in the available data, we consider nonparametric techniques advantageous. Hence, we will develop GAM and survival models. We shall 
compare the results of a dataset with details of the tumor core and clinical parameters with those including features of cancer margins. We aim to verify
a significant difference found in the previous analysis, confirm the results through nonparametric methods, and get more insights into the dataset.


**Remark:** We provide only the code developed for the project. The dataset is covered by an NDA agreement, thus it is not uploaded here.
